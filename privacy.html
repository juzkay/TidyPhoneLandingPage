        <h1>TidyPhone — Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 16, 2025</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>TidyPhone</strong> ("<strong>TidyPhone</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>") collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use the TidyPhone mobile application (the "<strong>App</strong>").</p>
        
        <h2>1. Summary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your photos are processed locally on your device.</strong> TidyPhone is designed not to upload your photo library to any server for analysis.</li>
            <li>We may collect limited information required to provide the App, support purchases, and improve reliability (for example, subscription status, basic device/app information, and diagnostics).</li>
            <li>We use reputable third-party providers to support purchases/paywalls and, if enabled, analytics.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The information we collect depends on how you use the App and what features you enable.</p>
        
        <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Support communications</strong>: If you contact TidyPhone, we may receive the information you provide (e.g., email address and message content).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.2 Device and App Information</h3>
        <p>We may collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App and device metadata</strong> such as app version, device model, operating system version, language/region settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Diagnostics and performance data</strong> to improve stability and troubleshoot issues (e.g., error codes, crash logs, and non-sensitive technical logs).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect the contents of your photos, videos, contacts, calendars, or other personal content.</p>
        
        <h3>2.3 Purchase and Subscription Information</h3>
        <p>If you purchase Paid Features, purchase processing is handled through Apple and may be managed via third-party providers that help verify subscription status and present paywalls. We may receive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subscription status</strong> (active/inactive), product identifiers, and purchase-related events.</li>
            <li><strong>Identifiers used for purchase verification</strong> (for example, app user IDs generated by purchase/analytics systems).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.4 Permissions and On-Device Data Access</h3>
        <p>If you grant permissions, the App can access:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photos</strong>: to analyze your library locally and help you find duplicates/similar items and manage storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Contacts</strong>: to help find duplicate contacts (if you use this feature).</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar</strong>: to help identify past events for cleanup (if you use this feature).</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: to deliver reminders/alerts (if enabled).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> This data is accessed on-device to provide features. TidyPhone is designed so that photo analysis occurs locally and photo content is not uploaded to TidyPhone servers for analysis.</p>
        
        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>TidyPhone uses information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide and operate the App and its features.</li>
            <li>Present paywalls and verify purchases/subscriptions.</li>
            <li>Improve performance, reliability, and user experience.</li>
            <li>Provide support and respond to inquiries.</li>
            <li>Prevent fraud and abuse and enforce our Terms of Use.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>We may share limited information with service providers that help operate the App. Examples may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purchase/subscription verification</strong> (e.g., RevenueCat).</li>
            <li><strong>Paywall presentation</strong> (e.g., Superwall).</li>
            <li><strong>Backend/analytics infrastructure</strong> (e.g., Supabase), if enabled in your build.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>
        
        <p>We may disclose information if required by law, to protect rights and safety, or to respond to lawful requests.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain information only as long as necessary to provide the App, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Retention periods vary depending on the type of information.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>TidyPhone uses reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
        <p>You can control your information in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Permissions</strong>: You can grant, deny, or revoke permissions in your device Settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: You can enable/disable notifications in device Settings and in-app settings (if available).</li>
            <li><strong>Purchases</strong>: You can manage subscriptions and purchases through your Apple ID settings.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). TidyPhone does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
        
        <h2>9. International Users</h2>
        <p>If you use the App outside your home country, information may be processed in locations where TidyPhone and its service providers operate. These locations may have different data protection laws than your jurisdiction.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we may provide notice in the App or by other means. Your continued use of the App after the effective date of an updated policy constitutes acceptance.</p>
