        <h1>TidyPhone — Terms of Use</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 16, 2025</p>
        
        <p>These Terms of Use ("<strong>Terms</strong>") are a legal agreement between you and <strong>TidyPhone</strong> ("<strong>TidyPhone</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>") governing your access to and use of the TidyPhone mobile application and related services (collectively, the "<strong>App</strong>" or "<strong>Services</strong>").</p>
        
        <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be able to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction to use the App. If you are using the App on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>
        
        <h2>2. License and Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, TidyPhone grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download and use the App on Apple-branded devices that you own or control, solely as permitted by the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions.</p>
        
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the App in any unlawful, harmful, or abusive manner.</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App, Services, or related networks.</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive source code from the App except to the extent permitted by law.</li>
            <li>Circumvent or attempt to circumvent feature gating, paywalls, or usage limits.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. App Functionality and Local Processing</h2>
        <p>The App helps you identify, review, and manage items on your device (such as photos and videos) to help you free storage space. <strong>TidyPhone is designed so that analysis of your photos occurs locally on your device.</strong></p>
        
        <p>The App may require permissions (such as Photos, Contacts, Calendar, and Notifications) to provide certain features. Your operating system may allow you to grant, deny, or revoke these permissions at any time. Some features may not function properly without the relevant permissions.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Purchases, Subscriptions, and Trials</h2>
        <p>The App may offer paid features through one-time purchases and/or subscriptions ("<strong>Paid Features</strong>"). Prices, billing periods, and trial availability are presented within the App at the time of purchase.</p>
        
        <h3>4.1 Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>If you purchase a subscription, it may renew automatically unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the then-current period. Your Apple ID account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</p>
        
        <p>You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings.</p>
        
        <h3>4.2 Free Trials</h3>
        <p>If a free trial is offered, it will convert to a paid subscription unless canceled before the trial ends. Trial availability and length are determined by Apple and/or the purchase platform and may vary.</p>
        
        <h3>4.3 One-Time Purchases</h3>
        <p>If the App offers a one-time purchase option, it provides access to the described features as presented at purchase time. One-time purchases are billed through your Apple ID.</p>
        
        <h3>4.4 Restores and Refunds</h3>
        <p>You may be able to restore eligible purchases using the App's "Restore Purchase" option or via Apple's mechanisms.</p>
        
        <p>Refunds are handled by Apple, not TidyPhone. For information, see Apple support resources on requesting refunds for App Store purchases.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App may integrate third-party services to provide functionality such as paywall presentation, purchase processing, and analytics. Your use of those services may be subject to their terms and policies. TidyPhone is not responsible for third-party services beyond what is required by applicable law.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Updates and Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update the App and change or discontinue features at any time. We may also update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we may provide notice through the App or by other means. Your continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
        
        <h2>7. User Content and Device Data</h2>
        <p>You remain responsible for the content on your device. The App may help you mark items for deletion and assist with cleanup workflows, but <strong>you are responsible for confirming actions</strong> before deleting or modifying content. Deletions may be permanent depending on device and operating system behavior.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TIDYPHONE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
        
        <p>TidyPhone does not guarantee that the App will be error-free or uninterrupted, or that it will identify all duplicates, similar items, or reclaim a specific amount of storage.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TIDYPHONE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUE, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP.</p>
        
        <p>IN NO EVENT WILL TIDYPHONE'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE APP EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO TIDYPHONE (IF ANY) FOR THE APP OR PAID FEATURES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</p>
        
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability, so some of the above may not apply to you.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>You may stop using the App at any time. TidyPhone may suspend or terminate your access to the App if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms or if required to comply with law.</p>
        
        <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which TidyPhone is established, without regard to conflict of laws principles. If applicable law requires a different governing law for consumer contracts, then that law will apply.</p>
        
        <h2>12. Contact</h2>
